# Tests conflict detection when overlapping @nodeId fields have different values
# - filmActorId "RmlsbUFjdG9yOjEsMg" = "FilmActor:1,2" → sets ACTOR_ID=1, FILM_ID=2
# - actorId "QWN0b3I6OTk" = "Actor:99" → tries to set ACTOR_ID=99
# This should throw an IllegalArgumentException because ACTOR_ID would be set to both 1 and 99
