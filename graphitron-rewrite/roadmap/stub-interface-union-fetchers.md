# Stub #3: Interface / union fetchers

Track A (`TableInterfaceType` variants) is **done**. Track B (multi-table polymorphic variants) remains and requires a design decision before any code can be written.

The companion cleanup item (`typeresolver-wiring-interface-union.md`) is absorbed here. Track A closes it for `TableInterfaceType`; Track B closes it for `InterfaceType` / `UnionType`.

Priority number `#3` must stay stable: it is embedded in emitted reason strings consumed by existing schema authors.

## Track B: Multi-table polymorphic

**Variants:** `QueryField.QueryInterfaceField`, `QueryField.QueryUnionField`, `ChildField.InterfaceField`, `ChildField.UnionField`

All four carry only `PolymorphicReturnType` — no table, no `MethodRef`. The classifier produces them when the return type is a multi-table `InterfaceType` or `UnionType` and no `@service` / `@tableMethod` is present.

### Design decision (resolve before coding)

Without a table binding or a method reference, there is no SQL for Graphitron to generate. Two options:

**Option 1 — Reject at classification.** These variants become `UnclassifiedField` when the field has no `@service`. The error message should say: "Multi-table interface/union fields require `@service` for developer-supplied dispatch, or `@table @discriminate` on the interface type for single-table polymorphism." The four variants disappear from the model; their `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_REASONS` entries and `stub(f)` arms are removed.

**Option 2 — Keep variants, improve the stub message.** The fetcher body emits a better `UnsupportedOperationException` message pointing to the two options above. Structurally the same as today but more actionable.

Recommendation: **Option 1.** Consistent with how the classifier already rejects other unsupported patterns. The model variants (`QueryInterfaceField`, etc.) may survive as separate classified paths if `@service` + interface-return becomes an explicit classification in the future.

### TypeResolver wiring for `InterfaceType` / `UnionType`

Even under Option 1, `InterfaceType` and `UnionType` exist in the schema (e.g. the `Node` interface, or user types whose fields are all `@service`-backed). Their TypeResolvers still need wiring.

Pattern: emit `codeRegistry.typeResolver("<Name>", env -> { ... })` for each non-`Node` `InterfaceType` and `UnionType` in `schema.types()`. Use the `__typename` convention: the resolver reads `record.get("__typename")` (same contract as `QueryNodeFetcher.registerTypeResolver`) and calls `env.getSchema().getObjectType(value)`. Document this as a required contract for `@service` methods returning multi-table interface / union types (see `graphitroncontext-extension-point-docs.md`).

## Order and gating

Track A is done. Track B's design decision (Option 1 vs. Option 2 above) is a prerequisite for any Track B code.

---

## Non-goals

- Per-participant sub-queries for multi-table interface fetchers without `@service` (requires a new directive or classification path).
- `NodeIdReferenceField` JOIN-projection form (tracked separately under Cleanup).
- TypeResolver for the built-in `Node` interface (already wired via `QueryNodeFetcher.registerTypeResolver`).

## Changelog

- **2026-04-27** — Track A complete. `QueryTableInterfaceField` and `ChildField.TableInterfaceField` lifted from `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_REASONS` to `IMPLEMENTED_LEAVES`. `discriminatorColumn` added to both records; classifier, `QueryConditionsGenerator`, `TypeFetcherGenerator` (new `buildQueryTableInterfaceFieldFetcher`, `buildTableInterfaceFieldFetcher`, `buildJoinPathCondition`), and `GraphitronSchemaClassGenerator` (TypeResolver wiring) updated. Fixtures: `content` table, `allContent` root query, `Film.filmContent` child field, `Content` / `FilmContent` / `ShortContent` SDL.
