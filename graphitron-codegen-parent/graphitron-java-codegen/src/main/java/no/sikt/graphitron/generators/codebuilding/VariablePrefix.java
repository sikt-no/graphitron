/**
 * This class handles the naming conventions for internal variables. When generating code, we need to name parameters and variables.
 * The different names may come from different namespaces. A namespace in this context is a set of strings, meaning a collection that has no duplicates.
 * A namespace can for example be the set of fields that a GraphQL type has, as there can not be two fields with the same name.
 * Therefore, using the names of the fields as variables is safe, as they will never collide with each other.
 * Another example is the set of internal helper variables in Graphitron-generated code, as these must also be unique and are predetermined by a single source, the developers.
 * When variables hail from different namespaces, however, they inevitably risk colliding in the generated code without proper countermeasures.
 * <p>
 * An example of a collision may be an input field (it will become a method parameter) which has the same name as a jOOQ table.
 * In the query Graphitron may create an alias for this table, while also having a method parameter that inherits the name of the input field.
 * Such code may result in uncompilable code at best or produce incorrect query results at worst.
 * <p>
 * The risk of collisions would be even higher for instance if the DB/GraphQL-domain was code-related.
 * To prevent such issues we use variable prefixes for all variables in the generated code.
 * These make it impossible to accidentally or intentionally produce naming collisions, given that the prefixes are not substrings of each other.
 * <p>
 * Here is a more rigorous explanation and proof for why this is needed:<br>
 * Assume two variable names N and M (which are based on user-defined configuration beyond our control or other factors such as DB-schema).
 * These two variables exist in their corresponding namespaces with their own prefixes P and Q where P ≠ Q and where there exists no string S such that P = S + Q or Q = S + P.
 * <p>
 * Let us take a look at the possibilities:<br>
 * 1. No prefixes are applied. Here, a conflict immediately emerges in the case N = M. As such, this solution is unacceptable.
 * <p>
 * 2. Prefixes are applied to only one namespace, P. This means that the resulting variable X in the code will be X = P + N.<br>
 *  One can easily engineer a problem case by assuming that M consists of two substrings concatenated such that M = P + N.<br>
 *  Since prefixes in the name space Q are not applied (are empty), we get that the generated variable Y will be Y = M = P + N = X, and so we have another collision.
 *  Thus, this solution is also unacceptable.
 * <p>
 * 3. Prefixes are applied for all namespaces. This time the generated variables will be X = P + N and Y = Q + M.<br>
 *  Let us disprove that there exist a case where X = Y. If X = Y, then P + N = Q + M. We have three possibilities:<br>
 *  * N = M results in P + N = Q + N and P = Q which is a contradiction with our premise P ≠ Q. So we have that N ≠ M.<br>
 *  * The next possibility is that the prefixes have the same length |P| = |Q|.<br>
 *    For this to be true and for the strings to still be equal, every character in P must match the one at the same index in Q, thus resulting in P = Q, contradicting P ≠ Q.<br>
 *  * Lastly, for |P| ≠ |Q| one of them must be shorter, so let us use |P| &lt; |Q|. This would be equivalent for |Q| &lt; |P|. Since P + N = Q + M, Q must use P as a prefix.<br>
 *    This means that Q = P + S where S is a non-empty string. This contradicts our second premise that there must not exist a string S such that P = S + Q or Q = S + P.<br>
 *  With this solution there can not exist a case where X = Y and variable naming collisions are impossible.
