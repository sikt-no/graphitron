Graphitron is a code generation tool that creates source code by linking GraphQL schemas to underlying database models.
Developed by **<a href="https://www.sikt.no"> Sikt â€“ the Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education and Research</a>**,
the tool generates precise source code for our systems, ensuring maintainability over time.

Graphitron is used as a Maven plugin, offering two main functionalities:
-   **Java Code Generation**: Creates Java source code from GraphQL schemas.
-   **Schema Transformation**: Modifies GraphQL schemas based on various configurations.
